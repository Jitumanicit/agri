                            <p>In the last few decades, agriculture has globally grown into a highly diverse but complex sector, with operational units ranging from small farm holdings to large corporate farming initiatives. Farm input and output are sold not only in local markets, but also across the world through sophisticated value chains. The global agriculture sector contributes towards 6.4% of the entire world's economic production. Total output of the agriculture sector is $5,084,80 Mn.</p>
                            <p>Even though agriculture represents a small share of the world’s economic output, the sector employs almost 30% of all workers.</p>
                            <p>Agriculture plays a crucial role in the economy of developing countries, and is the main source of food, income and employment to the rural populace. Underdeveloped regions rely on agriculture for a substantial portion of their GDP. </p>

                  China is the biggest contributor in agriculture followed by India. Both the countries account for 19.49% and 7.39% respectively of the overall world-wide agricultural production. United States is third in place followed by Brazil and Indonesia.

                <p>The food processing industry is of great importance as it offers vital links as well as synergies that it encourages between agriculture and industry. Globally, it is the leading sector across the world considering the total number of enterprises within the sector. Its significance and potential may also be credited to the scope for economic value addition offered in the sector. Globally, food processing is expected to grow by 6% up to 2021, while processing of higher-value-added foods in emerging markets is predicted to grow by 9%. Packaged food industry is another growing segment of the food processing industry.  Key market drivers include technological improvement, changing lifestyle, modern retail trade and increased popularity of quick service restaurants.</p>
                <p>Dairy is one of the major segments of the food processing industry, greatly benefited by the emergence of dairy processing as the fastest growing food producing sector in the world. Over the years, with emerging new markets and technologies, the sector has widened its scope Asia continues to dominate the global dairy market. China, India and countries in South East Asia account for a major portion of the global dairy industry, but milk supply in these regions has not been able to keep pace with the level of growing demand. These markets offer huge potential for dairy companies that are looking to target global demand for dairy products. </p>
                <p>With the increasing demand for high value food crops, agriculture diversification towards high-value crops can potentially increase farm incomes especially in countries where demand for such crops is increasing more quickly than that for staple crops.  Over the last 30 years, consumption of eggs and meat has more than tripled. According to FAO projections, meat demand in low and middle income countries will increase by a further 80 percent by 2030 and by over 200 percent by 2050. Throughout the world, major shifts in dietary patterns are occurring, even in the consumption of basic staples towards more diversified diets both in urban and rural areas as well as among rich and poor households.</p>

                            <p>Over the years, India has made tremendous development in the Agricultural sector from being a food deficit to self-sufficient and from a net importer to a net exporter of agricultural commodities. Agriculture plays a vital role in India’s economy as 54.6% of the total workforce is engaged in agricultural and allied sector activities (as per Census 2011) and accounts for 17.1% of the country’s Gross Value Added (GVA) .</p>
                            <p>Agriculture and allied sectors have four sub-sectors, i.e. crops (horticulture and field crops), livestock, forestry, fishing and aquaculture. Nearly, 58% of India’s population is dependent on Agriculture and its allied sectors, including horticulture, for primary source of livelihood. The availability of high proportions of agricultural land and 15 agro-climatic Zones encourage the cultivation of varied crops in the region. For holistic rural development, sustainable agriculture in terms of rural employment, food security, and environmentally sustainable technologies such as biodiversity protection, soil conservation and sustainable natural resource management, are duly essential. In India, agriculture and allied activities have undergone several revolutions to finally reach this stage today.</p>
