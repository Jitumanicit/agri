        		<p style="color: black; font-size: 15px;">Assam is situated in the North-East region of India-bordering seven states viz. Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, and West Bengal. It is the state of heterogeneous population with socio-cultural and ethnic diversity. Notably it is situated in the high rainfall zone which makes it naturally potential to support production of food grains in abundance.</p>
        		<p style="color: black; font-size: 15px;">The state covers an area of 78,438 km2 (30,285 sq. mi). It is bordered by Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh to the North; Nagaland and Manipur to the East; Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram and Bangladesh to the South; and West Bengal to the West via the Siliguri Corridor, a 22 kilometres (14 mi) strip of land that connects the state to the rest of India. Myanmar lies in about an hour distance connected to the easternmost part of Assam. Notably, almost 27.4% of the land in the State is under forests. The major source of revenue from this sector is from timber (367 species), cane and bamboo (52 species), followed by stone-gravel-sand.</p>
        		<p style="color: black; font-size: 15px;">Further, about 87% of the population in Assam is rural, with 74% dependent on agrarian and allied activities. The principal crop under cultivation (constituting 67% of gross cropped area) is rice. Apparently the area under horticultural crops cannot be specified as most of it is grown on non-commercial lines in homesteads. There is potential (yet to be tapped) for rapid growth in many areas which can result in this sector providing vital inputs for agro-based and other industries. </p>
        		<p style="color: black; font-size: 15px;">Many processed food products such as chips, semi-processed / frozen vegetables, juices, jams, spice preparations, etc. can be produced using these crops as raw material. These food-processing industries are not necessarily large industrial units, but are small & medium scale units (even household operations) with enormous scope for local employment.</p>
